# printboard
my submission(s) for the hack club you-ship-we-ship program called [printboard](https://printboard.hackclub.com) where we had to make cad models of printable skadis models of things that <ins>interface with ikea pegboards</ins>, look aesthetic and also serve a purpose :3 we were allowed to use any cad application so i opted to work with the education plan of autodesk fusion 360 (windows)

### headphone holders
a pretty straightforward cat themed model to hold your headphones and have them displayed in a super cool manner

### meds holder
being disabled means having to take a lot (and i really mean a LOT) of meds, most of which come in bottles (instead of blister packs). it is why i wanted to have something that's actually useful for me in my day-to-day life and displays my meds neatly on the pegboard and doesn't require you to unscrew and take out the bottle each time you wanted to take off the cap

### mcdonalds fries mmm
i was very hungry and really really out of ideas
