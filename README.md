# printboard
my submission(s) for the hack club you-ship-we-ship program called [printboard](https://printboard.hackclub.com) where we had to make cad models of printable skadis models of things that <ins>interface with ikea pegboards</ins>, look aesthetic and also serve a purpose :3 we were allowed to use any cad application so i opted to work with the education plan of autodesk fusion 360 (windows)

### headphone holders
a pretty straightforward and simple cat themed model to hold your headphones and have them displayed in a super cool manner on the pegboard. it has more support than those headphone holders that are just tiny hooks holding the entire weight of the headphones, making them less stable and more prone to damage / falling

### meds holder
being disabled means having to take a lot (and i really mean a LOT) of meds, most of which come in bottles (instead of blister packs). it is why i wanted to have something that's actually useful for me in my day-to-day life and displays my meds neatly on the pegboard and doesn't require you to unscrew and take out the bottle each time you wanted to take off the cap

### mcdonalds fries mmm
i was very hungry and really really out of ideas
